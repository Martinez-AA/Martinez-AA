***Welcome to my academic webpage!***

I write papers under my full name but prefer *Agustina* otherwise. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.](http://economics.uc3m.es/) Starting in September 2023, I will join the [University of Leicester School of Business](https://le.ac.uk/school-of-business) as a Lecturer in Economics.

I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in political and development economics. My research focuses on understanding how social interactions affect social norms and individual behavior, especially in the political and public spheres. 

You can find my CV [here](https://alejandraagustinamartinez.github.io/files/martinez_cv.pdf) and contact me at
