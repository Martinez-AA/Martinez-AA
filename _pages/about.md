***Welcome to my academic webpage!***

I am Agustina, a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.](http://economics.uc3m.es/)

I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in political and development economics. My research focuses on understanding *how social interactions affect individual behavior*, especially in the political and public spheres. 

You can find my CV [here.](https://alejandraagustinamartinez.github.io/files/martinez_cv.pdf)
